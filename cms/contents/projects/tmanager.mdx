**TManager** is a dedicated platform built to streamline travel planning for soccer teams.
From friendly matches to international tournaments, organizing logistics for a group of athletes
can be chaotic, TManager makes it intuitive.

<br />
Once registered, users are assigned to one or more teams based on their role
(coach, manager, staff) and can begin planning travel for upcoming games. The
platform guides them through each step: selecting hotels, booking
transportation, scheduling activities, and managing logistics — all while
keeping budgets and team needs in check.

<br />
## ✨ What I Built
<br />
A **feature-rich front office and back office in Angular**, designed for fast,
modular workflows. The UI lets team managers view, plan, and update trips with
just a few clicks — minimizing manual coordination and spreadsheets.
<br />
A **high-performance backend built with Fastify and Prisma**, providing secure,
efficient access to all travel and team data. The system is designed to handle
multiple concurrent users, scalable team roles, and complex relational data like
accommodations, itineraries, and cost breakdowns.
<br />
## 🛠 My Role
<br />I managed the fullstack development of TManager, focusing on delivering
a clean and responsive UI while ensuring the backend could support complex
trip workflows and role-based team management. From database modeling to user
experience, the goal was to create a product that felt custom-built for the
real-world needs of sports organizations.
