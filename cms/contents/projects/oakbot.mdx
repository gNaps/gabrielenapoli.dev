**OakBot** is a Telegram bot built to assist Pokémon fans with quick,
nteractive access to game information. All through simple chat commands. Whether
you’re in the middle of a battle or deep into strategy planning, OakBot delivers
what you need in seconds.

<br />
Designed and developed entirely in **Node.js** with the **grammY** framework,
the bot connects to a GraphQL Pokémon API and transforms it into a streamlined
conversational experience.
<br />
## ✨ What OakBot Can Do
<br />
**Detailed Pokémon Insights** With a command like `/stats pikachu`, OakBot
returns a compact data sheet: base stats, abilities, evolutions, and moves —
everything you need to know before making your next move.
<br />
**Type Matchup Analysis** Want to check if your Gengar is vulnerable to Ground
types? Use `/type gengar` to get a full breakdown of strengths and weaknesses
based on its type combination.
<br />
**Evolution Chains** Curious about how Eevee evolves into all its forms? The
`/evo` eevee command shows the entire evolution tree, including conditions and
branching options.
<br />
## 🔧 My Role
<br />I built OakBot from scratch, from structuring the bot logic and command
handling, to designing the integration with the Pokémon GraphQL API. I focused
on making the bot **performant**, **responsive**, and **easy to expand**. Thanks
to Telegram’s flexibility, OakBot works seamlessly across devices and platforms,
offering Pokémon fans a handy, real-time reference tool wherever they are.
