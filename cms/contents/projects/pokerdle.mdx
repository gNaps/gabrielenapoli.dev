Pokerdle is a project that revisits the popular game Wordle with a Pokemon theme.
You have 6 attempts to discover the mysterious Pokemon and at each attempt you will have clues
based on your answers. The clues are: generation, first type, second type, initial letter of
the name, etc. The project is written in Next.js and uses ISR to update the new Pokemon every day.

<br />
Pokerdle has the following features:

- **Fun and challenging gameplay**: Pokerdle tests your knowledge of Pokemon and your ability to guess
  the hidden word. You can use the clues to narrow down your options and try different combinations of letters.
- **Random and dynamic content**: Pokerdle generates a new Pokemon every day, so you will always have a
  fresh and different challenge. You can also see the previous days' Pokemon and your results.
- **Responsive and interactive UI**: Pokerdle has a simple and elegant UI that adapts to different screen
  sizes and devices. You can also use the keyboard or the mouse to enter your guesses.
