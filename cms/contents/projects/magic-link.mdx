**Magic Link** is a lightweight Node.js library designed to revolutionize how users log into applications.
Forget passwords with Magic Link, all it takes is an email address. The library generates a secure,
time-sensitive token and delivers it to the user’s inbox. One click, and they’re in. It’s that easy.

<br />
No friction. No forgotten credentials. Just a smoother, safer way to
authenticate.

<br />
## ✨ What It Does
<br />

- **One-click login**: Users enter their email, receive a unique link, and access the app with a
  single tap — no password required.
- **Secure by design**: Each token is single-use, time-limited, and cryptographically generated
  to prevent brute-force attacks or reuse.
- **Seamless integration**: Magic Link fits naturally into any Node.js stack, with flexible
  configuration and support for popular email providers.

<br />
## 🔧 My Role
<br />I built Magic Link to help developers implement **frictionless
authentication** in minutes without compromising security. I designed the token
system, handled secure email delivery, and ensured that the library could be
easily integrated and customized. Developers can configure token expiration,
email templates, and redirect behavior, all with minimal setup.

<br />
This project was all about **balancing UX with security**, and making authentication something users 
barely notice because it just works.
