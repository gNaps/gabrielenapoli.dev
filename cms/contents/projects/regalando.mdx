**Regalando** (Italian for _“giving a gift”_) was born to solve a common
problem: gift-giving should be joyful, not stressful. Whether you're
unsure what to buy, managing a wedding registry, or tired of receiving
gifts you don't need — Regalando makes the entire process simple, elegant, and fun.

<br />
With Regalando, users can curate their own wishlists and share them with friends
and family. The twist? Gift choices remain a surprise — you’ll never know who
picked what until the big moment. No duplicates, no awkward returns, just
meaningful gifts chosen with care.
<br />
The platform is available both as a mobile app and a web application, offering a
smooth, modern experience across all devices.
<br />
## ✨ What I Built
<br />
A **mobile app in Flutter**, designed to offer a native-like experience for both
Android and iOS users. The UI is sleek and intuitive, allowing anyone to build
and share a wishlist in minutes.
<br />
A **Next.js web app**, optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility. Whether
users are browsing gifts from a phone or desktop, the experience is fast and
frictionless.
<br />
A **robust backend on Supabase**, handling authentication and secure media
storage for product images and user avatars.
<br />
## 🛠 My Role
<br />I led the end-to-end development of Regalando: from defining the product
experience to integrating cross-platform components and architecting a backend
that could scale. A key challenge was ensuring privacy, so no gift choices were
accidentally revealed while keeping the UX effortless and clean.
