  Licks NFT is a fullstack project that allows you to create musical NFTs. An
  NFT is a unique digital token that represents a piece of art, such as a song,
  an album, or a video clip. NFTs are stored and verified on a blockchain, which
  is a distributed ledger that ensures the authenticity, ownership, and scarcity
  of the digital assets.
  <br />
  ### Frontend
  <br />
  The frontend of Licks NFT is built with Next.js, a React framework that
  enables fast and dynamic web development. The frontend interacts with the
  backend through web3.js, a library that allows you to communicate with the
  Ethereum blockchain. The frontend also integrates with Metamask, a browser
  extension that acts as a wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web.
  Metamask allows users to connect to the Licks NFT platform and sign
  transactions with their private keys.
  <br />
  ### Backend
  <br />
  The backend of Licks NFT is composed of smart contracts written in Solidity, a
  programming language for the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are
  self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain and enforce the rules and
  logic of the application. The smart contracts of Licks NFT handle the
  creation, transfer, and management of the musical NFTs, as well as the payment
  of royalties to the creators.

  ### Benefits of using blockchain and NFTs
  <br />
  Blockchain and NFTs offer several advantages for the music industry, such as:
  <br />- Security: Blockchain and NFTs eliminate the risk of fraud, piracy, and
  unauthorized copying. Users can trust that the musical NFTs they buy or sell
  are genuine and belong to them.
  <br />- Transparency: Blockchain and NFTs provide a clear and public record of
  the ownership and history of the musical NFTs. Users can track and verify the
  provenance and authenticity of the digital assets.
  <br /> - Innovation: Blockchain and NFTs enable new forms of expression and
  creativity for the musicians and the fans. Users can create, collect, and
  trade unique and original musical NFTs that reflect their personality and
  taste.
  <br />- Empowerment: Blockchain and NFTs give more control and freedom to the
  musicians and the fans. Users can bypass the intermediaries and the
  gatekeepers of the traditional music industry and directly connect with each
  other.
