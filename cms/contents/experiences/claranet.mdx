In this role, I joined a company collaborating with a major global fashion brand, where we were
responsible for the frontend of their **e-commerce platform**. This experience marked a return to a
**frontend-focused role**, allowing me to deepen my expertise in building **complex**, **high-performance user
interfaces** and refine my approach to testing and code quality. We followed a **test-driven development (TDD)
methodology**, which helped foster a strong culture of maintainable and well-tested code.

<br />
The tech stack was centered around **Next.js** giving me the opportunity to work
with the latest features of the React ecosystem, including **SSR**, **SSG**,
**API routes**, and **app routing**. This role allowed me to sharpen my skills
in **scalable frontend architecture**, performance optimization, and automated
testing, working closely with cross-functional teams in a fast-paced,
high-quality development environment.
