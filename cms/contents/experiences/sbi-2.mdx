In my most recent role, I returned to the **company where my journey began**, bringing with me
the experience and knowledge gained over the years. My focus has been on leading a **deep refactoring**
process of legacy systems, introducing a **modern tech stack** based on **Angular 20+**, **.NET Core 10+**, and a
**microservices architecture** to improve **scalability**, **maintainabilit**, and **performance**.

<br />
I’ve worked primarily on **business-critical management systems** and
**progressive web apps (PWAs)**. One of the most significant projects I’ve led
recently is a PWA for employee attendance tracking, designed to streamline the
management of working hours and on-site presence. This role allowed me to merge
**modern frontend and backend practices** in a structured enterprise
environment, applying everything I’ve learned about clean architecture,
modularity, and system evolution.
