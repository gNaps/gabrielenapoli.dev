My career began with a **university internship**, which quickly evolved into a full-time role within
the development team. I worked primarily on **business management software**, including **ERP** and **CRM** systems
tailored to client needs. The main tech stack included **C#**, **SQL Server**, and **AngularJS**, and I contributed
to building a **proprietary development framework** called Agevole, designed to streamline the creation of
enterprise applications. In addition to the core management platforms, I also developed **custom solutions**,
such as a company expense tracking app, built using **hybrid technologies** like **Cordova** and **Ionic** to ensure
cross-platform mobile support.
