In this role, I returned to working across the **full stack,** this time fully immersed in the **JavaScript
ecosystem**. The company operated as a **product-based business** managing its own **e-commerce platform**, primarily
selling student travel experiences. This experience marked an important step forward: I began working with
a **microservices architecture** and **asynchronous event-driven systems**, gaining a broader understanding of how
to build and scale distributed applications. On the frontend, I worked with **Angular** and **Nuxt**, while the
backend was built with **Node.js** and **NestJS**. We used both **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** for data persistence,
depending on the nature of the service. We deployed everything in the cloud using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**
on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

<br />I also took on **DevOps responsibilities**, writing and maintaining
**CI/CD pipelines** and managing cluster deployments — gaining hands-on
experience with infrastructure as code and cloud-native operations.
