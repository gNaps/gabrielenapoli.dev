After gaining solid fullstack experience, I decided to **focus more deeply on frontend development**,
modernizing my tech stack and embracing more contemporary frameworks like **Angular** and **React**.
At Kalpa, I primarily worked with Angular, contributing to the development of **frontend applications for
IoT products**.

<br />
Some of the key projects I was involved in included: **a dashboard for smart
lighting installers**, used during the installation and setup process; a
**remote control interface for smart ovens**, enabling users to monitor and
manage devices in real time; several **custom dashboards** for visualizing and
interacting with IoT data

<br />
During this time, I also started working in **cloud-based environments**,
gaining hands-on experience with **Docker** and **AWS** to support the
deployment and scalability of the applications I built. This role marked a
significant step in my growth as a **modern frontend engineer**, combining UI
development with **cloud-native workflows**.
